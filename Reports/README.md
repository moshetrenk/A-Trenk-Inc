# Reports
NJ Division of taxation reports from Easybiz software PDF files. The input report should come from Reports>Sales>Inventory Sales Report. Although subcategory reports are much more common and what you probably would default to, I suggest using the category report rather than item or subcategory because subcategories are not required and if an item was inadvertantly input without a subcategory then that item will only be included in this report if it's done by category.
