			Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the http://www.trenktobac.co website operated by A Trenk Inc (throughout these terms, A Trenk Inc may be referred to by several terms including "us", "we", "our", "A Trenk Inc", "A Trenk Tobacco", "A Trenk", "Trenk", or "Trenk Tobacco"). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service. 
			<br><br>1. You agree not to use this site in any malicious way. This means that you will not attempt to harm the site, the functions of the site, or the services provided by the site in any manner. You will not attempt to overload the site, you will not place orders that are not intended for purchase, and you will not in any manner not described here do anything that can in any way be bad for the site or A Trenk Inc.
			<br><br>2. You agree that you will not violate local, state, or federal law in the use of this site. Given the legal nature of the tobacco industry, you agree that if you place an order, you will only do so if you have fulfilled the relevant legal requirements. For retail stores, this includes obtaining an updated Cigarette Retailer's License. Do not attempt to place an order if there is any law that indicates that you may not be allowed to purchase tobacco items.
			<br><br>3. Since payments for our company are not done online, we have avoided password enabled login to make the order process easier for our customers. Instead we require a verified email address, for information on how to verify your preferred email address, please call us at 201-435-7751. We do not have stored accounts for retail customers and as such we store the details of your previous orders in a cookie on your computer. This has two benefits, first that customer data is safer since it is not all stored in one place, rather each customer's information is stored on their local computer and sent to us as needed, and second it removes the need for login with a password. If you would like to use this service to place an order, you will be required to provide your email address, phone number, and the name of your business. By placing an order, you agree to let A Trenk Inc place a cookie on your computer which will store all of the information pertinent to your order including those details as well as the items and quantities that you ordered. Furthermore, the data transferred to us and to you via email in the confirmation of your order is not secured by any practical means. This means that the contents of your order (including the items, quantities, comments, the store name, the email address provided, and the phone number provided) can be maliciously intercepted by hackers or other agents. For further information on the security of data submitted here, please see <a href = 'https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer'>PHPMailer</a>, the service we use to send the email confirming your order to your verified address and to ourselves at trenktobacco@gmail.com. Although remarkably unlikely, it is possible that the data you use here will become public or otherwise no longer private. <b>Most important in these terms is that you indemnify A Trenk Inc and any of its current, past, or future affiliates from from any legal action whether or not it is pertinent to the use of the site, cookies, your data, or anything else. It is explicitly stated here that if for any reason you will ever file or attempt to file any legal action or suit against A Trenk Inc, its ownership, affiliates, or employees, you will not use this site and use of this site is an explicit waiver of your right to any legal action or legal recourse. In the event of any dispute, A Trenk Inc will work in good faith as we always have to resolve it without the need for any legal action on our part. We strive to always keep our customers satisfied and we state clearly that we do not intend to use this clause for malicious intent. As such, by you using this site, you enter a binding legal contract which precludes you from any legal action on your part towards A Trenk Inc.</b>
			<br><br>4. We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
			<br><br>5. Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by A Trenk Inc. A Trenk Inc has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that A Trenk Inc. shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
			<br><br>6. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 (change this) days prior notice to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. While we do not intend to do so, we may change this terms with no notice.
			<br><br>8. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.
